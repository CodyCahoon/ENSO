To start server:

Node.js

1. Install Node.js LTS (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. `npm -version` to make its installed 
3. `npm install http-server -g`
2. Clone this repository and run `http-server` from the ENSO directory 
3. Visit localhost:8080

Python
---

1. Open terminal, cd to directory folder containing all of our content
2. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` which will serve on port 8000 by default

To parse data:

Java
---

1. cd into java folder and run:
2. `javac Runner.java` - to compile
3. `java Runner` - to run

This will read in raw2.data and create output.json. I then run output.json through a formatter (https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) and then paste that as my data.json file.
